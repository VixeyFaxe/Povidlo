Please do not judge strictly, this is just a training project and not all solutions in the code can be good. It is possible that this source code will help someone. 

The program was developed for Mac OS computers with Apple M2 chips. If you want to migrate to Intel, then you need to change the instruction code for interception (This does not guarantee full operation of the injector, but it will allow it to start).

At the time of uploading the code to GITHUB, the addresses are already outdated, so you need to update them.
